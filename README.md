This repo is to show off the shiny dashboard and work I did as part of my capstone project in the Master in Data Science program at UBC. I replaced the data of our partner with some other data and used it to find some interesting insights. The data came from Hadley Wickham who pulled and formatted it from http://www.transtats.bts.gov . I took the raw data from Hadley and massaged into a format acceptable to my shiny app and the forecoming models.
